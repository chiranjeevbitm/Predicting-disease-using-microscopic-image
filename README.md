# Predicting-disease-using-microscopic-image

In this project, I took the dataset from https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ . and performed machine learning algorithm to predict the infected blood cells

In the dataset we get two types of microscopic images of blood cells.

Parasitized Images
        [Infected Images]

![Infected Images](/infected&%20hist.png)
     
     
Uninfected Images
        [Non Infected Images]
             
![Non Infected Images](/uninfected%20hist.png) 
 
       
Then I have standarized the whole sample image into equal dimension so that, Machine Learning algorithms can be easily deployed.
