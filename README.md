# Predicting-disease-using-microscopic-image

*project is under progress

In this project, I took the dataset from https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ . and performed machine learning algorithm to predict the infected blood cells

In the dataset we get two types of microscopic images of blood cells.

1. Parasitized Images
        Infected Images
             
2. Uninfected Images
        Non Infected Images
       
       
       
For performing operations on the image data i have converted the images into its numpy matrix data.
