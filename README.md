# Predicting-disease-using-microscopic-image

In this project, I took the dataset from https://ceb.nlm.nih.gov/repositories/malaria-datasets/ . and performed machine learning algorithm to predict the infected blood cells

In the dataset we get two types of microscopic images of blood cells.

1. Parasitized Images
        ![Infected Images]("infected hist.png")
        
             
2. Uninfected Images
        ![Non Infected Images]("uninfected hist.png")
       
       
       
Then I have standarized the whole sample image into equal dimension so that, Machine Learning algorithms can be easily deployed.

![Test Images]("testdata.png")
